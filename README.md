> Learning Deno while using Vue SSR

This is experimental project to get a feeling of working with Deno.

* Use Vue SSR to put some Markup on the screen.

* Working without any Node-based tooling, just to see how well that works.


Next Steps:

* see if we can get the component compiler and SFCs to integrate with Deno.

* rinse and repeat for Vue3

* In principle, [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) should be a good match for Deno (Works with ES-modules, browser-oriented). What is required to get it running? I call this _Project devito_.
